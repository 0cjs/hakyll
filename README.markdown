# Hayll

Hakyll is a simple static site generator library in Haskell. It is mostly
inspired by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), but I like to
believe it is simpler. An example site where it is used is
[my personal homepage](http://jaspervdj.be) of which
[the source code](http://jaspervdj.be/snapshot.tar.gz) is available as a
reference.

## Installation

cabal install hakyll

## Tutorial and information

More information can be found on
[the hakyll homepage](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll).
